# EWC Compute: The Digital Engineering Platform 

Welcome to EWC Compute, the flagship Digital Engineering platform by the Engineering World Company. EWC Compute bridges the gap between traditional physics-based solvers and modern Accelerated Computing, AI, and DevOps. We empower engineers to deploy containerized, software-defined simulation environments and real-time digital twins. 

## 🎯 Vision & Core Pillars

The industrial engineering landscape is shifting from slow, siloed desktop workflows to unified, cloud-accelerated, AI-driven environments. EWC Compute serves as the orchestrator and unified UI/UX dashboard for this shift.

1. Software-Defined Templates: Define simulation parameters and infrastructure as code (IaC).

2. Accelerated Solvers (cuDSS & CUDA-X): Offload heavy mathematical calculations (Matrix Factorization, Linear Solves) to state-of-the-art GPU architectures.

3. PhysicalAI Assistance: Leverage conversational agents to automate meshing setup, interrogate historical engineering data, and build reports.

4. The "Aerodynamics Shortcut": Hybrid workflows enabling rapid real-time AI surrogate prototyping combined with high-fidelity numerical validation.

## Repository Architecture

Our GitHub Organization tracks our modular microservices and third-party upstream forks. Here is how the EWC ecosystem is organized:

### 🌟 Core Repositories
* ewc-compute-platform-1 (This Repo): The central hub containing platform specifications, architectural decision records (ADRs), and unified deployment scripts.

* ewc-ui-dashboards: Modern Next.js/React web app for user authentication, telemetry monitoring, and secure enterprise logins.

* ewc-physical-ai: Python-driven backend microservices hosting our LLMs, vector DBs (RAG), and agentic toolkits for engineering chat.

* ewc-compute-templates: Curated Dockerfiles and Terraform scripts containerizing OpenFOAM, structural FEM, and custom solvers.

### 🍴 Forked & Tracked Upstreams
We maintain curated forks of open-source solvers, benchmarking how they perform when accelerated by NVIDIA CUDA libraries.

Check our organization page to see our active forks and tracked dependencies!

### 🛠️ Platform Features


### 🏁 Getting Started for Developers
#### Prerequisites
* Git

* Docker & NVIDIA Container Toolkit (for local GPU acceleration tests)

* Node.js v18+ (for UI dashboards)

* Python 3.10+ (for PhysicalAI microservices)

### Installation
Clone the meta-repository and install the local developer orchestrator tools:

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/EWC-Compute-Platform/ewc-compute-platform.git
cd ewc-compute-platform
make install-dev
```

### 🤝 DevOps & Pull Request Standards
To ensure software stability in high-stakes engineering environments, we enforce strict continuous integration and deployment.

### PR Requirements
1. **Branch Naming**: ```Bash
                       feature/ewc-[ticket-number]``` ,
```Bash
fix/ewc-[ticket-number], or docs/update.
```
2. **Issue Linking**: Every PR must address an open Issue in the repository.
3. **Continuous Integration**: Automated GitHub Actions (Linters, Unit Tests) must pass before a review can be assigned.
4. Review Policy: At least one Peer Approval is required for *main* merge.
   #### Template Check: Please use our standard
   ```Bash
     .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
   ```
    when opening a contribution.
